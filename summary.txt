Euro Trip Destination Recommender

The Euro Trip Destination Recommender was created with the goal of helping the trip planner decide where to go.
The user is prompted with questions in 3 categories: weather, cultural sites, and cost. Based on the user's
preference among these 3 categories, the ETDR will calculate scores for every country in Europe and recommend
the top (and bottom) choices. On the back end, the calculator is pulling data from Weatherbase, UNESCO,
and Numbeo and applying weights based on the user's preference in order to generate rankings.
